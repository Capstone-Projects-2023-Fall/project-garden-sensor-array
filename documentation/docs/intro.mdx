# Introduction

## **Why Garden Sensor Array?**

Have you ever looked at your plants and thought "If they could only tell me what they need, this
would be so much easier! If only there was some kind of way for me to be able to interpret its needs
instead of just sitting here as it droops and wilts!"? Well with Garden Sensor array you can do that, and more! 

**Garden Sensor Array gives you, the plant caretaker, the capabilities to read:** 
- The amount of sunlight the plant is receiving.
- The moisture level of the plants soil
- The ambient temperature of the immediate area.

GSA does this through the use of a device called a Sensor Control Unit, or **SCU** for short. Each SCU
utilizes built in sensors which, once placed inside your garden, allows you to passively record the aforementioned metrics.

Each HUB can communicate with up to 5 separate SCUs at once, allowing you to closely monitor your garden no matter how large it is. 

**"That's great" you might say "But what if my plants are at an off-site location, like a community garden?
Does that mean I have to go all the way there in order to check in on them?"**

Not at all! SCUs reports their data wirelessly to a connected **HUB**, which then formats that data to be sent upstream and displayed
on the web, so that it's available where ever you are! All you have to do is log into your account, and you can check in on your garden from anywhere! 

**"What if I just can't bear to be out of eyesight of my garden for more than a moment?" we hear you cry!
 Well don't worry, we've got you covered there as well!**

In addition to the previously mentioned sensors, which are integrated into the SCUs, the HUB itself also supports a image capture with an attached camera. 
When attached, it will periodically capture and upload pictures of your garden as well!
