# Introduction

## **Why Garden Sensor Array?**

Every day I look at my plants and wonder if they could tell me what they need this
would be so much easier. If only there was some kind of way for me to be able to tell its needs
instead of just seeing it droop or wilt. With Garden Sensor array you can, and more! 

**Garden Sensor Array gives you the plant caretaker the capability to tell** 
- the amount of sunlight its receiving.
- how wet is the soil
- what's the current temperature of the ambient area.

We do this through our device we call a **SCU** or also known as a Sensor Control Unit. This device 
utilizes two sensor devices that can be placed beside your garden to give you these metrics.

**Do you want to be able to visually see and ensure they're doing alright like the awesome plant parent you are?**

You can do that too, as we have a camera attatched to what we like to call the HUB. This device aggregates
all your metrics to one device so that it may transmit through a local WiFi to your webpage. This device
is able to take a photo of your garden and update your profile so that you may see your plants grow in REALTIME!

You may connect up to 5 individual SCUs to collect your metrics. 

**That's great you might say, but what if my plants are at a community garden or an off-site location.
Does that mean I have to go all that way in order to see these metrics?**

- No! In fact our emphatic team has created a means to have your own online profile will tell you
all these metrics through valuable graphs of these metrics at our website. You'll be able to see from 
the comfort of your home how your plants are doing.
