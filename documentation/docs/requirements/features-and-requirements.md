# Features and Requirements

## Functional Requirements

* System must be able to track a plant’s sunlight exposure, temperature, and soil moisture
  *	Users must be able to track sunlight so that they can properly ensure the plant's UV intake.
  *	Users must be able to track temperature so that they can properly ensure the plant's ambient temperature is survivable.
  *	Users must be able to track soil moisture so that they can properly ensure the plant's water intake is sustainable.

* System must be able to show info to user while user is far away from the plants
  * Users must be able to provide login credentials to the system to connect it to the internet
  * Users must be able to view all relevant data (sun, moisture, temperature) from the sensors remotely

* System components must be able to withstand harsh outdoor conditions
  * System must be waterproof, as well as be able to operate under a wide range of temperatures
  * The system must also be secured in some way to prevent various critters from displacing it


## Non-functional Requirements 

* Availability: 
  * High Uptime: The sensors that are connected should be available for use at nearly any time of the day.  
  * Weather Resistant: The sensors will be protected by cases, that will allow them to still read the plant’s vitals properly, but without getting damaged from inclement weather. 
  * Website Availability: The website is also available 24/7 for users to login into and use under any circumstance.  

* Performance: 
  * Real-time Response: Sensor immediately transfers requested data to database –which is then reported directly to user on website.  

* Accessibility: 
  * Setup is Simple: The Garden Sensors should be easy to connect to the hub when setting up the device.  
  * LED Visual Aid: LED light attachments on sensors to visibly show hydration and sunlight levels.  

* Usability:
  * Instructions Given: Understandable descriptions and explanations must be supplied to help ensure the sensors and the website are straightforward. 
  * Clear Interface: The Garden Sensor Website will have a very clear and easy to use interface. With useful elements like preference options and clearly defined data which makes the website easier to operate. 

* Accuracy:
  * Low Percentage Error: The Garden Sensors must achieve 5% or less in percentage error. 
  * Only Keeps Necessary Info: The sensors should only send the database data when prompted to/activated by the user. Only important data is recorded, freeing up its capacity from irrelevant data and maintaining high accuracy and response time. 

* Scalability:  
  * Easy Linking on Website: The website makes it easy for the user to connect additional monitored garden bed.  The site is carefully organized to minimize confusion on which plant bed is which. 

* Security:  
  * Mandatory Login: To access plant data from personal sensors on the website, the system must require successful user login.  
  * User Authentication: System prompts user to answer security questions and recreate login credentials if forgotten.  
  * Wi-Fi Authentication: Required to authenticate network connection to ensure user safety.
